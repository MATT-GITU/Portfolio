Hello! I'm Matthew Gitu, an aspiring Data/Business Analyst with a strong passion for using data to uncover insights, solve problems, and drive business decisions. Currently studying economics, I have a background in econometrics, mathematics, and both micro and macroeconomics. I combine these academic experiences with my work in data analysis, aiming to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable business strategies.

On my GitHub, you’ll find projects where I explore data analysis techniques, create models, and share my learning journey as I strive to refine my skills in business analytics. I'm always open to new challenges, and I’m excited about the opportunity to apply my knowledge to real-world problems.

Feel free to check out my repositories, contribute, or connect with me if you're interested in collaborating!
